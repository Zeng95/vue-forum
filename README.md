<h2>Note:</h2>

1. The src directory contains our application's code.
2. Main.js is the application's entry file.
3. When start building an application it is usually handy to work with a local file or mockup before hitting an API or another source.
4. If the browser tries to reload the page, this shouldn't happen in a Single Page Application.
5. The class selector is way faster than the element selector, because it is more specific.
6. It's recommended to use camelCase names when using CSS Modules.
7. Keep the logic that alters the state in the parent component.
8. It's recommended to place the global styles in the root component's style tag insted of importing it in the HTML head tag as you would normally do.
9. Each Vue.set is an individual state change.
10. Create and Update things are usually all together.
11. The benefits of using higher-order functions are that the code is reusable and wirte less.
12. Each component is a Vue instance.
13. The created hook is a great time to fire an AJAX call.
14. The mounted hook is similar to JQuery's ready function.
15. We should fetch only the data we need.
